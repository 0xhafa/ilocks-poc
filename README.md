# ILOCKS - Incentivized Token Lock
ILOCKS is a token time lock and token vesting decentralized application. It is a simple dapp that holds digital assets for some time and vests tokens according to predefined conditions. 

Token locks and token vesting applications are a common use case for smart contracts. It is maily used to: 
- Protect liquidity, reducing the risk of liquidity being pulled all at once by project owners, the famous rug-pull, and also ensuring liquidity for market participants.
- Reduce Sell Pressure, Projects can lock a percentage of their pre-mined token supply or team-owned tokens. this way, the community, and investors can be reassured that tokens will not be mass dumped by the team during the contract period.
- Reward Contributor, DAOs use token vesting mechanisms to reward investors and contributors with governance tokens with reduced price impact due to distribution deferred over time.

# Ouline of Problem
Despite of the utility of token locks and token vesting applications, the main projects offering these services provide limited customization for their users. The three main service providers only offer customization of lock duration (days) and vesting frequency (hour, day, week, month and etc.).

# The Solution
Using ILOCKS, the user can set the following parameter for the lock: duration, fees, incentives, and also how these parameters will behave over time.

# How it works
Operators can create a lock schedule specifying: starting data, release dates, token locked, reward rate, vesting schedule, and fees.

The User selects a lock and lock their tokens to receive a fungible position of locked tokens. After locking the can claim their reward tokens according to the predifined schedule.
